\section{Topic Migration}
In our proposal, we planned to explore DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) using different dataset. Now we decide to make our project more application specific. We want to realize fashion clothes generation and synthesis using IcGAN (Invertible Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) [1]. In [1], IcGAN is used to do face synthesis, that is given an input face picture, the network is able to generate a target facial picture with specified characteristics, such as wearing glasses, having bang or being bald. In our application, we want to apply the same idea to DeepFasion dataset[3], which consists of more than 800,000 fashion images.

\section{Progress}
Currently we have built the proposed IcGAN model[1] using TensorFlow. The architecture composes of two encoders, one encoding the latent representation z and the attribute information y. We will train the encoder $E_z$ along with the cGAN and train encoder $E_y$ separately. To generate a modified image, we will apply variation on the attribute vector to have different conditions such that we can generate a image with the same structure as the input image but different flavors.

Moreover, we preprocessed DeepFashion dataset[3] by applying the bounding boxes of the clothes and scaling the images to better accommodate our application.
